### Hi there!

---

My name is James Keywood, I love creating open source and efficient programs.

Come and check out my profile, hopefully you like some of my repositories.

---

I usually make programs in the following languages:
- Python
- C#
- Bash

Currently I'm working on the following repositories:
- [cybertank](https://github.com/jameskeywood/cybertank)
- [geno](https://github.com/jameskeywood/geno)
- [webgl](https://github.com/jameskeywood/webgl)

My current WebGL game is hosted on [this](https://jameskeywood.github.io/webgl/) GitHub Page.

At the moment I am spending most of my time on my computer science A-level coursework.
This is not being developed on GitHub, but snippets may be displayed on my WebGL page.
